# SNN-Terminal
This is the AI terminal which is used to simulate neural networks created by the SNN Builder. There are no training algorithms included, as this was mostly designed to be used as a nuanced flowchart system with neurotransmitters, however I have created a genetic algorithm for the terminal before but I have not included it here as it was very shabby and only a proof of concept. The networks you create in the SNN Builder will be opened by the terminal as long as you have the same ai_model name in settings.

To port into ROBLOX just search for all comments including --@enable and make sure to do what is said in comment.
Certain things may be left out so to be extra vigilant you may want to destroy all functions which start with "love".

To test out different inputs/add exeptions to specific neurons behavior, you can access the "data" file in your LOVE2D savefile folder, inside the snn folder.
