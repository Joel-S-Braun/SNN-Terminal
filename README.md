# SNN-Terminal
This is the SNN terminal. You can use this to actually use the AI in any other platform which uses Lua, however is built to be ported into ROBLOX or used in LOVE2D. To port to ROBLOX, all you need to do is combine the scripts in order; for details of the order and what to change, use ctrl f9 @enable to find the comments mentioning what to do. You can also use the terminal to simply run the SNN in LOVE2D to have more detailed neuron state data. The terminal uses the same save file as the builder, so if you want to test any AI you built you can simply run the terminal with same edit settings to test it. Genetic algorithims may be implemented in the future.

This is how the terminal looks. You can edit the data.lua file within the savefile, to change the exeption list and the inputs, or you can integrate dynamic inputs for the SNN.
